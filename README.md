# Health-analysis

The project analyzes health insurance data to uncover insights about various factors affecting insurance charges. By exploring demographic variables such as age, gender, BMI, children, smoker status, and region, we aim to identify trends and correlations that impact insurance costs. The analysis utilizes Python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, ensuring a comprehensive examination of the dataset.
